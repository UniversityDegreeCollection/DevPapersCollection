## Papers about effectiveness of basic masks

The papers below have been used to create a video summarizing the utility of basic masks. In summary: everyone should wear masks, which they should make themselves using t-shirts or paper towels, whenever they go out in public. Here’s the video. I’ve also made a little [summary on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward/status/1242894378441506816?s=20).

Testing the Efficacy of Homemade Masks: Would They Protect in an Influenza Pandemic?


2013

Masks: 
-- surgical
-- homemade (cotton tshirts)
-- no mask
n=21

-- (p=.002)
-- (p=.007)
--surgical mask was 3 times more effective in blocking transmission than the homemade mask

--homemade mask should only be considered as a last resort to prevent droplet transmission from infected individuals, but it would be better than no protection.

Addressing COVID-19 Face Mask Shortages



Mar 2020


--DO NOT use alcohol and chlorine-based disinfection methods.These will remove
the static charge in the microfibers in N95 facial masks, reducing filtration efficiency. In addition, chlorine also retains gas after de-contamination and these fumes may be harmful.

Rational use of face masks in the COVID-19 pandemic
Mar 2020


--It is time for governments and public health agencies to make rational recommendations on appropriate face mask use to complement their recommendations on other preventive measures, such as hand hygiene. WHO currently recommends that people should wear face masks if they have respiratory symptoms or if they are caring for somebody with symptoms.

Effectiveness of Masks and Respirators Against Respiratory Infections in Healthcare Workers: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis


2017
meta-analysis
--This systematic review and meta-analysis supports the use of respiratory protection. 
--However, the existing evidence is sparse and findings are inconsistent within and across studies

Physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses


2011
meta-analysis
--67 studies including randomised controlled trials and observational studies with a mixed risk of bias.
--Simple and low‐cost interventions would be useful for reducing transmission of epidemic respiratory viruses. Routine long‐term implementation of some measures assessed might be difficult without the threat of an epidemic.

Effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza: A systematic review and meta-analysis
Feb 2020
meta-analysis
--The use of N95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza. --It suggests that N95 respirators should not be recommended for general public and non-high-risk medical staff those are not in close contact with influenza patients or suspected patients
--, the sensitivity analysis after excluding the trial by Loeb et al18 showed a significant effect of N95 respirators on preventing respiratory viral infections (RR=0.61, 95% CI 0.39-0.98, P < .05).

Simple Respiratory Mask
2006


--WHO recommends protective equipment including masks (if they not available, a cloth to cover the mouth is recommended) for persons who must handle dead or ill chickens in regions affected by H5N1 (5).
-- Quality commercial masks are not always accessible, but anecdotal evidence has showed that handmade masks of cotton gauze were protective in military barracks and in healthcare workers during the Manchurian epidemic (6,7). 
--simple, locally made, washable mask may be a solution if commercial masks are not available.

What Hospitals Should Do to Prepare for an Influenza Pandemic
2006


--Limit accidental droplet contamination of the hospital environment by implementing respiratory etiquette and by having everyone entering the facility (staff, patients, and visitors) use simple surgical masks. Assuming that resupply may be difficult during a pandemic, hospitals should stockpile enough masks for 3 weeks.
--Shortages of N95 masks should be anticipated,
--If no other masks are available, surgical masks, which will provide droplet protection, should be used.3 Powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) should be available for use in high risk aerosol-generating procedures.

Understanding what we mean when we discuss airborne virus infection risk.

ebola


For a virus described as spreading only through direct contact, recommendations for the use of masks, implying airborne spread to many, fuel such questions.  In fact, face protection is recommended to prevent infectious droplets landing on vulnerable membranes (mouth and eyes).

A cluster randomised trial of cloth masks compared with medical masks in healthcare workers


2015

masks:
--cloth
--medical
n=1607

--Clinical respiratory illness (CRI), --influenza-like illness (ILI) --respiratory virus infection
--Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.
--Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection. Further research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally. However, as a precautionary measure, cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated.

How effective are face masks in operation theatre? 
A time frame analysis and recommendation


2013


Wherever  the  surgeon  operates  more 
than 2-3 hours at a stretch, he/she should change their face mask every 1.5 to 2  hours
--study  helps  to  establish that in developing countries, where resources could be a constraint for  providing disposable face masks,  the 
fabric face masks can also be used equally effectively
if changed frequently ideally at around 90 minutes.

N95 Respirators vs Medical Masks for Preventing Influenza Among Health Care Personnel


2019

masks:
--N95
--medical

(p=0.18)
N95 respirators vs medical masks as worn by participants in this trial resulted in no significant difference in the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza.

role of facemasks and hand hygiene in the prevention of influenza transmission in households: results from a cluster randomised trial;


2012
n=84 households
Results suggest that household transmission of influenza can be reduced by the use of NPI, such as facemasks and intensified hand hygiene, when implemented early and used diligently. Concerns about acceptability and tolerability of the interventions should not be a reason against their recommendation.

Facemasks and hand hygiene to prevent influenza transmission in households: a cluster randomized trial.


2009
n=407 vs n=794
Hand hygiene and facemasks seemed to prevent household transmission of influenza virus when implemented within 36 hours of index patient symptom onset. These findings suggest that nonpharmaceutical interventions are important for mitigation of pandemic and interpandemic influenza.

2010
n=1437
These findings suggest that face masks and hand hygiene may reduce respiratory illnesses in shared living settings and mitigate the impact of the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic.
